## Spring 2021 Web Development Challenge - Game Landing Page

This is the ninth project in my [Spring 2021 - Web Development Challenge](https://10in30.alexander-morse.com/) series, where I am attempting to design, code, and ship ten different web projects in the space of one month, under a variety of constraints.

This project was a simple landing page for some hypothetical video game. The featured technology here is the Stylus CSS preprocessor, with ParcelJS to bundle everything.

A live version of this project can be found running [here](https://arm-ac-game-landing.surge.sh/).

In any exercise, it's always the last few reps that command the bulk of one's willpower, and this month's challenge has been no exception. By now, I've run into enough roadblocks and setbacks that the questions I started out with have been largely answered (more on that at the start of May), and the only thing to do now is finish off the month - ideally without another failure.

I was *supposed* to have fun with this project. The mock-up for it had been designed since the first week of April, and it was one of the better designs this month. But while this project isn't a failure by the rules of the challenge, it certainly doesn't look like it should. Most of this is just down to me running out of time - I didn't even get the chance to prepare any imagery for it.

I decided to try the Stylus CSS preprocessor as my main technology this time. By no means did I use it *well*, or even elegantly. However, it might actually be my favorite CSS language out of those I've tried this month, beating out Sass and Less. I used it through ParcelJS, which once again was used as my build tool. Unfortunately, my choice to use Parcel also cost me a bit of time, since (at the time of writing) its HMR has a tendency to crash every 10-20 updates. I also had some trouble using Stylus's import feature consistently, though I'm not entirely sure why. At a certain point, I went ahead and just wrote everything in the top-level file.

I have to admit: I'm getting a little tired at this point. But I have one more project to go.
